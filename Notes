Two core features of Vue
------------------------
- Declarative Rendering: Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe
HTML output based on JavaScript state.
- Reactivity: Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.
